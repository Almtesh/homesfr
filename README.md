# What's this?

This is a set of libraries to control your Home by SFR account.
They all work around the website.

# What's Home by SFR?

Home by SFR is a security and automation service provided by the French Internet provider SFR.
The library was only tested for the French version because I don't know if it exists elsewhere

# Licence

These libraries are under GNU GPL v3.
